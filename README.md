## **Time Bomb - Web Programming Project (Not Finished)**

This repository contains the source code for a Time Bomb project developed in the Web Programming discipline in the year 2023, under the guidance of teacher **[Fred Barbosa](https://github.com/fbamuniz)**. Bomba Relógio is an interactive web application developed using fundamental web technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### **About the project:**
The Time Bomb is a practical project that aims to demonstrate the concepts learned during the Web Programming course. The application simulates a digital time bomb, where the user can use commands on the "bomb" numpad to control its actions, with a countdown 30 seconds, password for deactivation and activation, abort counting, continue counting and at the end of the count, an "explosion" on your screen.

### **Contributions:**
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to propose improvements, fix bugs or add new features to the application. Simply fork this repository, make the desired changes, and submit a pull request for review.

The code contains some bugs that have not yet been resolved because the delivery of this task was canceled by the teacher before the due date.
Enjoy and have fun exploring the Time Bomb!
